# [King Mod]
## About
King Mod provides your game server with a unique, and interesting new type of game mode, previously unavailable to the public. This plugin used to be a private plugin, only available to one Scandinvaian community, but after seeing how many people had fun and enjoyed the gaming experience I eventually decided on releasing it to the public, in the hopes that more people will come to have enjoyable experiences playing this game mode.

When King Mod is installed, the gameplay on the server changes dramatically.
The premise of the game mode is that two teams play against each other.
Everybody starts with nothing but a knife available to them.
The first person to kill an enemy, will become the new "King", increasing their health, and granting them one of a total of 26 different and very powers.

It is now up to the King's team to try and protect him, while also attempting to kill any enemies. When a regular enemy is slain while the King is on your team, your team is awarded 1 point. Killing opposing team's King awards 3 points, and turns the killer in to the new King, granting a new unique power.
The objective for each team is to accumulate as many points as possible. The team with the most points at the end of the round, wins the round.
